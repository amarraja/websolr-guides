It's simple -- just fork the repository on GitHub and send us a pull request!

If you would like a nicer GUI in order to see your changes in context, install the `gollum` gem and use it to run a local instance of the Gollum web service. See the [Gollum home page](https://github.com/github/gollum) for more information about how it is used.
